            <h5>Why choose me?</h5>
            <p>I know I'm not the most qualified or anything, but I am a hard worker. When I am giving a task I get it done. I am loving and kind. Thats all I should need to show that I will be great for the job.
            </p>

        <p>I’ve been through a lot in my life and I’m only sixteen-years-old. I never knew that I would overcome the problems that I had but I am. I think that’s why I’m a strong person. The things that I experienced made me scared and I wanted to
hide, but I can't, so I try my best to do what is right and stand up for what I believe in.
<br>
However, I always find myself asking “why is my life this way?” and "why can't it be like this?", but then I remember the things I have been taught and believe "look for the beauty in everything". 
</p>

    <p> I have an interest in computer programing and I will start my online studies in april 2022 and hopefully save up enough money to continue on campus at byu.
    <br>
My brother and I play a sport caled squash. We love to go and play together and enjoy the physical exercise. I have a teem that i play with every Thursday in a business league (all this can be adaptable).
<br>

        <p>The question of who am I seems to be the simplest question one can answer. Yet, when I took the time to try and figure out Who am I, I found this question is the one that requires critical thinking. In general, the answer to this question is that I am a regular person who loves spending quality time with the people I appreciate.  In addition, I dedicate myself to completing my duties, and I have a dream of becoming a great person. However, there are so many other things that make me a good person, if you just take the time to get to know me.</p>
